# House Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The model is implemented in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Overview

The house price prediction model utilizes a combination of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. It takes into account a range of features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors to estimate accurate house prices.

## Requirements

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Pandas (version X.X.X)
- NumPy (version X.X.X)
- Seaborn (version X.X.X)
- scikit-learn (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Run the main script:

```shell
python house_price_prediction.py
```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the dataset containing house information is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV or Excel). Adjust the file path and column names in the script accordingly.

2. Data preprocessing: Utilize Pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. Explore and visualize the dataset using Seaborn.

3. Model training and evaluation: Apply linear regression, decision trees, and random forests from scikit-learn to train the models. Evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error or R-squared).

4. Predicting house prices: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data. Modify the script as needed to input the desired features.
